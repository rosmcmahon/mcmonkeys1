## Hello 👋

- I am currently working on, and maintaining several Arweave based projects
- 🤝 Are you looking to collaborate on fun stuff?
- 🧐 Controlled fun, with TypeScript (it's typed Javascript)
- 👀 I’m looking for help with: design, front-end, back-end, all the things 😃 so little time in one life
- 💲 Do you like money? Maybe you can have some for collaborating. All skill levels welcome, no time pressure 💲 Let's talk!
